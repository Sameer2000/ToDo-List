# ABOUT
This is a To Do List Project in which user can add any task of any category for a particular date. The data that user entered will be stored in a database. You can access this web application by running it on localhost:3000 after installing express.

# TECHSTACK
Node.Js, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Express.Js

# APPROACH
I created a local server and used EJS view engine to set up the front end part of this application. I used Express.js to make the server and used Mongo DB to create the database.
